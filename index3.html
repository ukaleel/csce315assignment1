           I hope you enjoyed the website idea, I was planning on doing some puzzle to get to the secret page but ended up getting busier over the weekend. If you were unable to get to the "secret" page, it is just a tiny hyperlink between the text that will take you to the "truth". <br><br> All matters on the other 2 pages are apart of the CSCE 210-315 storyline and have no root in reality.
